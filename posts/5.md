Before I get into my own drivetrain design, I want to address a *nearly* excellent idea I got from a peer last week. I was joking around with friends, when someone suggested I should "hack" a roomba and use that as a drivetrain. As someone who has an old roomba laying around, this idea seemed excellent. It would save me money on motors and motor controllers, and would give me a chassis to work with.

However, after doing some research, this idea has a few problems.

Problem 1 is that we still occasionally use our roomba, and it would be tough to convince my parents to let me take apart our roomba, as old as it may be. Problem 2, which is most relevant to me, is that many robot vacuums use custom motor controllers that aren't easily reverse engineered.

Without the ability to use the existing motor controllers, the cost of an old roomba would primarily go towards its casing and motors. This is useful in a way, but the case design would limit the ways I could configure sensors and would mean I'd have less control over the hardware. Since I want to do this mostly from scratch, I think I'll have to scrap that option.

Anyways, below is my sketch for my drivetrain:

As you can see, it implements a differential drivetrain with support for plenty of sensors. It also has dedicated spaces for the computer, battery, motors, and motor drivers, meaning I'll have plenty of space for any sensors I choose to add. Note that parts shown are not necessarily to scale, but should give a rough idea until I can order parts and CAD a 3D model. The primary constraint Im working with is that my chassis length can't be more than 256mm or 10 inches (this is the limit of my 3D printer). I could print it in multiple halves, but I doubt that will be necessary.
