Today, I just want to brainstorm to get some ideas for my RC car. I've located an image of something I think will look similar to the RC car I want to make; I picked this one because it appears to be budget-friendly and uses custom electronics so I can add whatever sensors I please.

In terms of capabilities, this is what I want my RC car to do (this list is a work in progress):

- Some form of hand-gesture control
- Obstacle avoidance

For the gesture control, I plan to accomplish this by either using a camera based solution on the robot, or more likely by using some sort of glove that can read my hand movements (I'll budget $20 for the glove if needed). For the obstacle avoidance, I'll probably use multiple ultrasonic sensors since they're cheaper than a camera and can still detect distances. If this proves too primitive, I'll switch to a camera-based system.

For overall budgeting, my plan is as follows:

```
Motors: $15
Frame: 3D printed, $2 worth of filament
Batteries: AA batteries (4)
Main computer: Raspberry Pi 3, $25
Voltage conversion: $5
Ultrasonic sensors: $10
Motor drivers: $10
Glove computer: ESP32, $10
Glove Inertial Sensor: $10
Glove batteries: (power bank), $5
Total: $92
```

This leaves me with roughly $8 left to play with to add cameras or more advanced sensors--not a lot! With this budget in mind, I can go forward with accomplishing my goal of making driveable robots significantly cheaper than what VEX robotics charges teams.
