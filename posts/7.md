Arguably, the most crucial componets of a mobile robot are the motor drivers. Generally, motors need a high power, high current DC source to turn on and spin. The motors I'm using have two wires. When the positive wire goes to the positive terminal of the battery and the negative wire goes to the negative terminal, the motor will spin forwards at its max speed. When the wires are reversed (+ to - and - to +), the motor will spin backwards. 

So how do we adjust the motor power and speed? We don't want to drive full speed all the time.

Motor power is measured in Watts, and can be determined through the equation P=IV, or power equals voltage times current. All motors have a no-load current, which is the current when you allow them to spin freely with nothing attached to them. As you add a load to a motor, the current increases, drawing more power. The specific current the motor draws is based on its "back EMF" through the formula *I = (V - B) / R*, or Current = (voltage - back EMF, which decreases as a load is applied) * the internal resistance of the motor.

Because of this equation, the way we control motor output power is by varying the voltage. Decreasing the voltage will decrease the current drawn, and therefore will decrease the power and speed of the motor.

This is the job of a motor driver, and we'll build a simple one from scratch to save cost. Our basic version will vary voltage through a technique called PWM. PWM, or pulse width modulation, basically turns a signal on and off rapidly, decreasing the average voltage based on how long the signal is on and off for. When visualized, it looks like this:

But we have one other problem: the power of our PWM signal will be far too low to drive the motor. Our signal is generated by a tiny computer, a microcontroller, and if we connected the motor to the signal directly we would quickly draw too much power from our microcontroller and break it. We need some way to convert our low current PWM signal to a higher current one to control a motor.

This is the job of a transistor. By applying a small amount of power to the input, or "base", of a transistor, we can control a much larger power source for the motor and "copy" our PWM signal to it. Let's now build our circuit:

This example I made uses a smaller motor as a test until our larger motors arrive, but it will work the same way. We use our small microcontroller to generate a PWM signal, then use a BJT transistor to copy and amplify it for the motor.

This works! As we increase the duty cycle, or the amount of time the signal is "on" for, the motor speed increases.
