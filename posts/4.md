After some consideration, I've decided to move away from AA batteries and instead use LiPo batteries. The primary reason for this is rechargability and higher peak current draw, which may be important for higher draw applications like robotics.

For motors, I've decided I'll use 2 geared motors. After considering my options, the cheapest and best route will be to use the NFP-GM12-N20-06165-26, which is a 6V, 16500RPM motor. I'll then select a 30:1 gearing, which will result in just over 300RPM under load. Converted to linear speed on 65mm wheels, this should allow me to hit roughly 2.8mph under load.

I'll use an H-Bridge motor driver to control the motor based on signals from my robot's computer, and a buck converter to step the voltage of my battery down to a proper level. Since 2S LiPo batteries operate at a nominal voltage of 7.4V, my buck converter will need to step the voltage down to 6V for the motor, then again to 5V for the Raspberry Pi I'll use to control the motors (I'll likely need two buck converters for this).

*Note: In electronics, a Buck Converter just steps voltage down from one level to another. An H-Bridge is used to control DC motors and their speeds based on signals from a microcontroller, like a Raspberry Pi*

As for telemetry between the band and the robot, I'll be using BLE, or Bluetooth Low Energy. It works differently from regular Bluetooth in that it uses less power, which is vital to a battery-powered wristband. The wristband will be the one sending a stream of telemetry to the robot, so they'll have to be relatively close together due to the small antennas in the wristband. I may consider using WiFi as a backup, but the issue would be latency as the wristband would have to use an external router with bigger antennas rather than an Ad-Hoc network or it would run into similar range issues to BLE. Pairing both devices to the school WiFi would address the range issue, but would increase latency due to an increase in the number of "hops" or steps between the devices.
