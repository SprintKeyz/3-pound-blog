While I recognize that this is the last week of our blog, it is *not* the last week of work I plan to do on my 3# project. I still hope to have an assembled robot ready for presentation, and I do believe that goal is achievable. Before discussing the robot though, I have a small piece of unfortunate news to share regarding my handheld controller: while I was soldering a battery to it, I clearly accidentally shorted some component on my board. I tried several things to fix this. I used flux paste plus a soldering iron heated to 450C to clean the solder pads I believe I bridged, then submerged my board in isoproply alcohol to clean it. I did eventually manage to salvage the board, but I had to disconnect the battery controller from the rest of the board to do it. Since these boards take a while to ship, I have to find a new option for getting the power from my battery and making it usable on my board.

Additionally, I noticed what looks to be a bit of corrosion on my board after I submerged it in isoproply alcohol for a few minutes. I'm a bit confused as to what could've caused this since it was my understanding that isoproply alcohol is non-corrosive, but I suppose it could've reacted with the chemicals in the flux solder pad cleaning paste I used.

The robot itself is quite a simple design. I considered actually modeling a car body, but decided that the spirit of my project is making something simple and affordable, so I stuck with a very basic model that's just enough to attach my parts to. This has two advantages: one, it provides many mounting options for my components, and two, it's quick to iterate on and improve if needed.

I can't quite assemble the robot yet since I'm waiting on my motor driver board to ship (the red board with the black heatsink), but I wrote some test code to communicate between the raspberry pi and the wristband. While I had to power the wristband over USB, I can confirm it works well, and communication one-way time was roughly 35ms which is generally below what humans will notice when operating vehicles or playing games.
