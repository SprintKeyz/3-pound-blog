As stated last week, unfortunately it's very difficult to obtain a final price for my robot until I actually hit the order button. However, like I was able to do with the wristband, I'll get a solid outline put together. This week, I don't want to dive into pricing too much. Instead, I'll get a game plan down for the rest of my robot.

I want my robot to behave similarly to an RC car, so I'll need 4 wheels with at least two motors. There are two primary ways you can steer a mobile robot; one is through ackermann steering (like a car), and the other is through differential steering, which works by providing a separate motor to each side of the drivetrain and spinning each side forwards or backwards to move the robot. There are other methods of steering, such as mecanum steering, but they certainly have their tradeoffs. Mecanum steering, for instance, *does* allow you to move sideways, but it requires special wheels that typically have less traction and sacrifice speed to increase mobility.

I think the option that makes the most logical sense for an affordable robot is differential steering. It allows for high maximum speeds if needed, a responsive drivetrain, and can turn in a perfect circle if needed. Plus, depending on how my budget turns out, I can choose whether to use two motors or four motors.
