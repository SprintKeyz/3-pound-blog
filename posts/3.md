As stated last week, unfortunately it's very difficult to obtain a final price for my robot until I actually hit the order button. However, like I was able to do with the wristband, I'll get a solid outline put together that should reflect a final price quite closely.

I want my robot to behave similar to an RC car, so I'll need 4 wheels with at least two motors. There are two primary ways you can steer a mobile robot; one is through ackermann steering (like a car), and the other is through differential steering.
