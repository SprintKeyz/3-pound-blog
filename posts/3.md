As stated last week, unfortunately it's very difficult to obtain a final price for my robot until I actually hit the order button. However, like I was able to do with the wristband, I'll get a solid outline put together. This week, I don't want to dive into pricing too much. Instead, I'll get a game plan down for the rest of my robot.

I want my robot to behave similarly to an RC car, so I'll need 4 wheels with at least two motors. There are two primary ways you can steer a mobile robot; one is through ackermann steering (like a car), and the other is through differential steering, which works by providing a separate motor to each side of the drivetrain and spinning each side forwards or backwards to move the robot. There are other methods of steering, such as mecanum steering, but they certainly have their tradeoffs. Mecanum steering, for instance, *does* allow you to move sideways, but it requires special wheels that typically have less traction and sacrifice speed to increase mobility.

For a visual, Ackermann:

And differential:

I think the option that makes the most logical sense for an affordable robot is differential steering. It allows for high maximum speeds if needed, a responsive drivetrain, and can turn in a perfect circle if needed. Plus, depending on how my budget turns out, I can choose whether to use two motors or four motors. It helps that through my career in VEX robotics, I've been successful in writing software for robots controlled through differential steering.

For batteries, I've decided to go with standard AA batteries. The three main reasons for this are as follows:

1. AA Batteries are generally cheaper than LiPo batteries when you get to the capacities needed for a robot.
2. AA Batteries in parallel have a higher current output than 9V batteries, so those aren't an option (we need high current for a robot)
3. AA Batteries can be easily changed and swapped out, and are pretty ubiquitous
